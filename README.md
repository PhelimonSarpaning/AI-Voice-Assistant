# AI-Voice-Assistant
Still an ongoing project but currently enables you to communicate, search Google using speech and also open applications on Macbook.

To use you need to install ElasticSearch, Selenium, ChromeDriver and SpeechRecognition.

brew install elasticsearch</br>
brew install selenium</br>
pip install SpeechRecognition</br>
pip install Chromedriver

You need to sign up for a Houndify Client Id and Client Key for transcribing the speech into text.

To run the application first open "elasticsearch" via the terminal and also open "python speech.py" via another terminal.

To alert the Voice Assistant, say  "Maame"
